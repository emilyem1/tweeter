# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The starter code was built on another repository. The code was then built upon to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node, Express back-end skills.

The tweets can be created via form, and have a max of 140 char. There is error handling present for invalid tweets. The tweets are displayed newest to oldest. The layout is responsive, having three separate designs for desktop, tablet and mobile breakpoints.
